"""
Script to clean up data about guests who attended Babbage's soir√©es in the 1830s and 1840s.
Data was first converted from a word doc to the parties_orig.csv file.

This script creates two new CSV files:
1. 'sources.csv' which contains the source information, including 
    - sourceID: a unique identifier
    - author_date_source: messy (author: year) - will probably be deleted and replaced 
      by the full bibliographic information as in a reference list
    - quote: the direct quote that describes the guests and the party
    - pages: page numbers in the bibliographic reference - will likely be combined with 
      bibliographic info
2. 'parties.csv' which contains the party information with QIDs for the guests
    - date: date - sometimes exact, sometimes just year or year-month. Needs formatting somehow.
    - guest: Name of the guest. Names of the aristocracy are complex - for instance, should
      Annabella Byron be listed as Lady Byron? Might need to ask a historian. Could go with 
      whatever name their Wikidata entry has as the main form.
    - qid: Wikidata identifier for the guest
    - sourceID: unique identifier for the source, matches sourceID in sources.csv
