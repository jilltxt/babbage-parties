# babbage-parties
A dataset about Charles Babbage's Saturday night soirées and the guests who attended them.

## Background
Charles Babbage was famous for his [Saturday night soirées](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage%27s_Saturday_night_soirées), which were attended by scientists, politicians, writers, artists and the rich and famous. He demonstrated his Difference Engine at these parties as well as other new inventions, and this is where Ada Lovelace and many others first encountered the idea of computing technology. This dataset provides a list of known guests at the soirées with references to the sources for that information, which are mostly published letters, memoirs and travel journals.

## How to use
The file `parties.csv` contains the main data, with the dates of parties, names of known guests, each guest's QID ([Wikidata](http://wikidata.org) identifier), the `sourceID` and quoted text that states that each guest was present.

## Status
The project is at an early stage. Next tasks:
* Go through each quote to check info and add whether the information is uncertain or ambiguous
* Compile list of bibliographic references
* Data analysis and visualisation
* Write up and share
