# babbage-parties
A dataset about Charles Babbage's Saturday night soirées and the guests who attended them.

##Background
Charles Babbage, the inventor of important early computers, was famous for his Saturday night soirées, which were attended by scientists, politicians, writers, artists and the aristocracy. This dataset provides a list of known guests at the soirées with references to the sources for that information, which are mostly published letters, memoirs and travel journals.

##How to use
The file parties.csv contains the main data, with the dates of parties, names of known guests, each guest's QID (Wikidata identifier) and the sourceID that matches the as yet unfinished list of sources and quotes in sources.csv. 

##Status
The project is at an early stage, more to come.
